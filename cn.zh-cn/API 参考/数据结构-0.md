Name is primarily intended for creation idempotence and configuration definition. Cannot be updated.0 characters < name length ≤ 63 characters.The name must be a regular expression [a-z0-9]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?.|
|clusterName|No|String|The name of the cluster which the object belongs to. This is used to distinguish resources with same name and namespace in different clusters. This field is not set anywhere right now and apiserver is going to ignore it if set in create or update request.|
|initializers|No|initializers object|An initializer is a controller which enforces some system invariant at object creation time. This field is a list of initializers that have not yet acted on this object. If nil or empty, this object has been completely initialized. Otherwise, the object is considered uninitialized and is hidden (in list/watch and get calls) from clients that haven't explicitly asked to observe uninitialized objects. When an object is created, the system will populate this list with the current set of initializers. Only privileged users may set or modify this list. Once it is empty, it may not be modified further by any user.|
|enable|No|Boolean|Enable identify whether the resource is available.|
|generateName|No|String|An optional prefix used by the server to generate a unique name ONLY IF the Name field has not been provided. If this field is used, the name returned to the client will be different from the name passed. This value will also be combined with a unique suffix. The provided value has the same validation rules as the Name field, and may be truncated by the length of the suffix required to make the value unique on the server.If this field is specified and the generated name exists, the server will NOT return a 409. Instead, it will either return 201 Created or 500 with Reason ServerTimeout indicating a unique name could not be found in the time allotted, and the client should retry (optionally after the time indicated in the Retry-After header).Applied only if Name is not specified.0 characters < generated name length ≤ 253 characters.The generated name must be a regular expression [a-z0-9]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?.|
|namespace|No|String|Namespace defines the space within each name must be unique. An empty namespace is equivalent to the "default" namespace, but "default" is the canonical representation. Not all objects are required to be scoped to a namespace - the value of this field for those objects will be empty. Must be a DNS_LABEL. Cannot be updated.0 characters < namespace length ≤ 63 characters.The namespace must be a regular expression [a-z0-9]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?.|
|selfLink|No|String|A URL representing this object. Populated by the system. Read-only.This field is automatically generated. Do not assign any value to this field. Otherwise, API calls would fail.|
|uid|No|String|UID is the unique in time and space value for this object. It is typically generated by the server on successful creation of a resource and is not allowed to change on PUT operations. Populated by the system. Read-only.This field is automatically generated. Do not assign any value to this field. Otherwise, API calls would fail.|
|resourceVersion|No|String|An opaque value that represents the internal version of this object that can be used by clients to determine when objects have changed. May be used for optimistic concurrency, change detection, and the watch operation on a resource or set of resources. Clients must treat these values as opaque and passed unmodified back to the server. They may only be valid for a particular resource or set of resources. Populated by the system. Read-only. Value must be treated as opaque by clients.This field is automatically generated. Do not assign any value to this field. Otherwise, API calls would fail.|
|generation|No|Integer|A sequence number representing a specific generation of the desired state. Currently only implemented by replication controllers. Populated by the system. Read-only.|
|creationTimestamp|No|String|A timestamp representing the server time when this object was created. It is not guaranteed to be set in happens-before order across separate operations. Clients may not set this value. It is represented in RFC3339 form and is in UTC. Populated by the system. Read-only. Null for lists.This field is automatically generated. Do not assign any value to this field. Otherwise, API calls would fail.|
|deletionTimestamp|No|String|RFC 3339 date and time at which this resource will be deleted. This field is set by the server when a graceful deletion is requested by the user, and is not directly settable by a client. The resource will be deleted (no longer visible from resource lists, and not reachable by name) after the time in this field. Once set, this value may not be unset or be set further into the future, although it may be shortened or the resource may be deleted prior to this time. For example, a user may request that a pod is deleted in 30 seconds. The Kubelet will react by sending a graceful termination signal to the containers in the pod. Once the resource is deleted in the API, the Kubelet will send a hard termination signal to the container. If not set, graceful deletion of the object has not been requested. Populated by the system when a graceful deletion is requested. Read-only.|
|deletionGracePeriodSeconds|No|Integer|Number of seconds allowed for this object to gracefully terminate before it will be removed from the system. Only set when deletionTimestamp is also set. May only be shortened. Read-only.|
|labels|No|Object|Map of string keys and values that can be used to organize and categorize (scope and select) objects. May match selectors of replication controllers and services.|
|annotations|No|annotations object|An unstructured key value map stored with a resource that may be set by external tools to store and retrieve arbitrary metadata. They are not queryable and should be preserved when modifying objects.不同的资源类型必填的annotation不同，详见具体的资源API。|
|ownerReferences|No|Array of ownerReferences objects|List of objects depended by this object. If ALL objects in the list have been deleted, this object will be garbage collected.

**表 77**  reason

|名称|值|描述|
|--|--|--|
|StatusReasonUnknown|“”|StatusReasonUnknown means the server has declined to indicate a specific reason. The details field may contain other information about this error.**Status code 500**|
|StatusReasonUnauthorized|Unauthorized|StatusReasonUnauthorized means the server can be reached and understood the request, but requires the user to present appropriate authorization credentials (identified by the WWW-Authenticate header) in order for the action to be completed. If the user has specified credentials on the request, the server considers them insufficient.**Status code 401**|
|StatusReasonForbidden|Forbidden|StatusReasonForbidden means the server can be reached and understood the request, but refuses to take any further action. It is the result of the server being configured to deny access for some reason to the requested resource by the client.Details (optional):"kind" string - the kind attribute of the forbidden resource on some operations may differ from the requestedresource. "id" string - the identifier of the forbidden resource**Status code 403**|
|StatusReasonNotFound|NotFound|StatusReasonNotFound means one or more resources required for this operation could not be found.Details (optional):"kind" string - the kind attribute of the missing resource on some operations may differ from the requested resource."id" string - the identifier of the missing resource**Status code 404**|
|StatusReasonAlreadyExists|AlreadyExists|StatusReasonAlreadyExists means the resource you are creating already exists.Details (optional):"kind" string - the kind attribute of the conflicting resource"id" string - the identifier of the conflicting resource**Status code 409**|
|StatusReasonConflict|Conflict|StatusReasonConflict means the requested operation cannot be completed due to a conflict in the operation. The client may need to alter the request. Each resource may define custom details that indicate the nature of the conflict.**Status code 409**|
|StatusReasonGone|Gone|StatusReasonGone means the item is no longer available at the server and no forwarding address is known.**Status code 410**|
|StatusReasonInvalid|Invalid|StatusReasonInvalid means the requested create or update operation cannot be completed due to invalid data provided as part of the request. The client may need to alter the request. When set, the client may use the StatusDetailsmessage field as a summary of the issues encountered.Details (optional):"kind" string - the kind attribute of the invalid resource"id" string - the identifier of the invalid resource"causes" - one or more StatusCause entries indicating the data in the provided resource that was invalid. The code, message, and field attributes will be set.**Status code 422**|
|StatusReasonServerTimeout|ServerTimeout|StatusReasonServerTimeout means the server can be reached and understood the request, but cannot complete the action in a reasonable time. The client should retry the request. This is probably due to temporary server load or a transient communication issue with another server. Status code 500 is used because the HTTP spec provides no suitableserver-requested client retry and the 5xx class represents actionable errors.Details (optional):"kind" string - the kind attribute of the resource being acted on."id" string - the operation that is being attempted."retryAfterSeconds" Integer - the number of seconds before the operation should be retried**Status code 500**|
|StatusReasonTimeout|Timeout|StatusReasonTimeout means that the request could not be completed within the given time. Clients can get this response only when they specified a timeout param in the request, or if the server cannot complete the operation within a reasonable amount of time. The request might succeed with an increased value of timeout param. The client *should*wait at least the number of seconds specified by the retryAfterSeconds field. Details (optional):"retryAfterSeconds" int32 - the number of seconds before the operation should be retried**Status code 504**|
|StatusReasonTooManyRequests|TooManyRequests|StatusReasonTooManyRequests means the server experienced too many requests within a given window and that the client must wait to perform the action again. A client may always retry the request that led to this error, although the client should wait at least the number of seconds specified by the retryAfterSeconds field.Details (optional):"retryAfterSeconds" int32 - the number of seconds before the operation should be retried**Status code 429**|
|StatusReasonBadRequest|BadRequest|StatusReasonBadRequest means that the request itself was invalid, because the request does not make any sense, for example deleting a read-only object. This is different from StatusReasonInvalid above which indicates that the API call could possibly succeed, but the data was invalid. API calls that return BadRequest can never succeed.|
|StatusReasonMethodNotAllowed|MethodNotAllowed|StatusReasonMethodNotAllowed means that the action the client attempted to perform on the resource was not supported by the code - for instance, attempting to delete a resource that can only be created. API calls that return MethodNotAllowed can never succeed.|
|StatusReasonInternalError|InternalError|StatusReasonInternalError indicates that an internal error occurred, it is unexpected and the outcome of the call is unknown.Details (optional):"causes" - The original error**Status code 500**|
|StatusReasonExpired|Expired|StatusReasonExpired indicates that the request is invalid because the content you are requesting has expired and is no longer available. It is typically associated with watches that cannot be serviced.**Status code 410 (gone)**|
|StatusReasonServiceUnavailable|ServiceUnavailable|StatusReasonServiceUnavailable means that the request itself was valid, but the requested service is unavailable at this time. Retrying the request after some time might succeed.**Status code 503**|

|ports|Yes|Array of ServicePort objects|The list of ports that are exposed by this service.|
|selector|No|Object|This service will route traffic to pods having labels matching this selector. Label keys and values that must match in order to receive traffic for this service. If empty, all pods are selected, if not specified, endpoints must be manually specified.|
|clusterIP|No|String|clusterIP is the IP address of the service and is usually assigned randomly by the master. If an address is specified manually and is not in use by others, it will be allocated to the service; otherwise, creation of the service will fail. This field **cannot be changed through updates. Valid values are "None", empty string (""), or a valid IP address**."None" can be specified for headless services when proxying is not required. Only applies to types **ClusterIP, NodePort, and LoadBalancer**. Ignored if type is ExternalName.|
|type|No|String|type determines how the Service is exposed. **Defaults to ClusterIP**. **Valid options are ExternalName, ClusterIP and LoadBalancer**. **"ExternalName"** maps to the specified externalName.**"ClusterIP"** allocates a cluster-internal IP address for load-balancing to endpoints. Endpoints are determined by the selector or if that is not specified, by manual construction of an Endpoints object. If clusterIP is "None", no virtual IP is allocated and the endpoints are published as a set of endpoints rather than a stable IP.**"LoadBalancer"** builds on NodePort and creates an external load-balancer (if supported in the current cloud) which routes to the clusterIP.社区版本支持nodePort类型的service，CCI场景下不支持该类型的service|
|externalIPs|No|Array of strings|externalIPs is a list of IP addresses for which nodes in the cluster will also accept traffic for this service. These IPs are not managed by Kubernetes. The user is responsible for ensuring that traffic arrives at a node with this IP. A common example is external load-balancers that are not part of the Kubernetes system.|
|externalTrafficPolicy|No|String|externalTrafficPolicy denotes if this Service desires to route external traffic to node-local or cluster-wide endpoints.**valid values are "Local" and "Cluster"**- **"Local"** preserves the client source IP and avoids a second hop for LoadBalancer and Nodeport type services, but risks potentially imbalanced traffic spreading.- **"Cluster"** obscures the client source IP and may cause a second hop to another node, but should have good overall load-spreading.|
|healthCheckNodePort|No|Integer|healthCheckNodePort specifies the healthcheck nodePort for the service. If not specified, HealthCheckNodePort is created by the service api backend with the allocated nodePort. Will use user-specified nodePort value if specified by the client. **Only effects when Type is set to LoadBalancer and ExternalTrafficPolicy is set to Local.**|
|externalName|No|String|externalName is the external reference that kubedns or equivalent will return as a CNAME record for this service. No proxying will be involved.Must be a valid DNS name and requires Type to be ExternalName.|
|sessionAffinity|No|String|Used to maintain session affinity. Enable client IP based session affinity.**Must be ClientIP or None.****Defaults to None.**|
|loadBalancerIP|No|String|**Only applies to Service Type: LoadBalancer**LoadBalancer will get created with the IP specified in this field. This feature depends on whether the underlying cloud-provider supports specifying the loadBalancerIP when a load balancer is created. This field will be ignored if the cloud-provider does not support the feature.|
|loadBalancerSourceRanges|No|Array of strings|Optional: If specified and supported by the platform, this will restrict traffic through the cloud-provide.load-balancer will be restricted to the specified client IPs. This field will be ignored if the cloud-provider does not support the feature.|
|publishNotReadyAddresses|No|Boolean|publishNotReadyAddresses, when set to true, indicates that DNS implementations must publish the notReadyAddresses of subsets for the Endpoints associated with the Service. The default value is false. The primary use case for setting this field is to use a StatefulSet's Headless Service to propagate SRV records for its Pods without respect to their readiness for purpose of peer discovery. This field will replace the service.alpha.kubernetes.io/tolerate-unready-endpoints when that annotation is deprecated and all clients have been converted to use this field.|

If this is a string, it will be looked up as a named port in the target Pod's container ports. If this is not specified, the value of Port is used (an identity map). Defaults to the service port.**Value range: (0,65535].**|
|nodePort|No|Integer|The port on each node on which this service is exposed when type=NodePort or LoadBalancer. Usually assigned by the system. If specified, it will be allocated to the service if unused or else creation of the service will fail.

|host|No|String|ost is the fully qualified domain name of a network host, as defined by RFC 3986. Note the following deviations from the "host" part of the URI as defined in the RFC: 1. IPs are not allowed. Currently an IngressRuleValue can only apply to the IP in the Spec of the parent Ingress. 2. The : delimiter is not respected because ports are not allowed. Currently the port of an Ingress is implicitly :80 for http and :443 for https. Both these may change in the future. Incoming requests are matched against the host before the IngressRuleValue. If the host is unspecified, the Ingress routes all traffic based on the specified IngressRuleValue|
|http|No|IngressRuleValue object|IngressRuleValue represents a rule to route requests for this IngressRule.If unspecified, the rule defaults to an http catch-all.

|clusterName|No|String|The name of the cluster which the object belongs to. This is used to distinguish resources with same name and namespace in different clusters. This field is not set anywhere right now and apiserver is going to ignore it if set in create or update request.|
|initializers|No|initializers object|An initializer is a controller which enforces some system invariant at object creation time. This field is a list of initializers that have not yet acted on this object. If nil or empty, this object has been completely initialized. Otherwise, the object is considered uninitialized and is hidden (in list/watch and get calls) from clients that haven't explicitly asked to observe uninitialized objects. When an object is created, the system will populate this list with the current set of initializers. Only privileged users may set or modify this list. Once it is empty, it may not be modified further by any user.|
|enable|No|Boolean|Enable identify whether the resource is available.|
|generateName|No|String|An optional prefix used by the server to generate a unique name ONLY IF the Name field has not been provided. If this field is used, the name returned to the client will be different than the name passed. This value will also be combined with a unique suffix. The provided value has the same validation rules as the Name field, and may be truncated by the length of the suffix required to make the value unique on the server.If this field is specified and the generated name exists, the server will NOT return a 409. Instead, it will either return 201 Created or 500 with Reason ServerTimeout indicating a unique name could not be found in the time allotted, and the client should retry (optionally after the time indicated in the Retry-After header).Applied only if Name is not specified.0 characters < generated name length ≤ 253 characters.The generated name must be a regular expression [a-z0-9]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?.|
|namespace|No|String|Namespace defines the space within each name must be unique. An empty namespace is equivalent to the "default" namespace, but "default" is the canonical representation. Not all objects are required to be scoped to a namespace - the value of this field for those objects will be empty. Must be a DNS_LABEL. Cannot be updated.0 characters < namespace length ≤ 63 characters.The namespace must be a regular expression [a-z0-9]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?.|
|selfLink|No|String|A URL representing this object. Populated by the system. Read-only.This field is automatically generated. Do not assign any value to this field. Otherwise, API calls would fail.|
|uid|No|String|UID is the unique in time and space value for this object. It is typically generated by the server on successful creation of a resource and is not allowed to change on PUT operations. Populated by the system. Read-only.This field is automatically generated. Do not assign any value to this field. Otherwise, API calls would fail.|
|resourceVersion|No|String|An opaque value that represents the internal version of this object that can be used by clients to determine when objects have changed. May be used for optimistic concurrency, change detection, and the watch operation on a resource or set of resources. Clients must treat these values as opaque and passed unmodified back to the server. They may only be valid for a particular resource or set of resources. Populated by the system. Read-only. Value must be treated as opaque by clients.This field is automatically generated. Do not assign any value to this field. Otherwise, API calls would fail.|
|generation|No|Integer|A sequence number representing a specific generation of the desired state. Currently only implemented by replication controllers. Populated by the system. Read-only.|
|creationTimestamp|No|String|A timestamp representing the server time when this object was created. It is not guaranteed to be set in happens-before order across separate operations. Clients may not set this value. It is represented in RFC3339 form and is in UTC. Populated by the system. Read-only. Null for lists.This field is automatically generated. Do not assign any value to this field. Otherwise, API calls would fail.|
|deletionTimestamp|No|String|RFC 3339 date and time at which this resource will be deleted. This field is set by the server when a graceful deletion is requested by the user, and is not directly settable by a client. The resource will be deleted (no longer visible from resource lists, and not reachable by name) after the time in this field. Once set, this value may not be unset or be set further into the future, although it may be shortened or the resource may be deleted prior to this time. For example, a user may request that a pod is deleted in 30 seconds. The Kubelet will react by sending a graceful termination signal to the containers in the pod. Once the resource is deleted in the API, the Kubelet will send a hard termination signal to the container. If not set, graceful deletion of the object has not been requested. Populated by the system when a graceful deletion is requested. Read-only.|
|deletionGracePeriodSeconds|No|Integer|Number of seconds allowed for this object to gracefully terminate before it will be removed from the system. Only set when deletionTimestamp is also set. May only be shortened. Read-only.|
|labels|Yes|Object|Map of string keys and values that can be used to organize and categorize (scope and select) objects. May match selectors of replication controllers and services.This field should be filled in to create the real storage dynamically.The value of the field is according to the real region and zone.|
|annotations|No|annotations object|An unstructured key value map stored with a resource that may be set by external tools to store and retrieve arbitrary metadata. They are not queryable and should be preserved when modifying objects.This field should be filled in to create the real storage dynamically.This filed indicates the storage plugin and the StorageClass.|
|ownerReferences|No|ownerReferences object|List of objects depended by this object. If ALL objects in the list have been deleted, this object will be garbage collected. If this object is managed by a controller, then an entry in this list will point to this controller, with the controller field set to true. There cannot be more than one managing controller.|
|finalizers|No|Array of strings|Must be empty before the object is deleted from the registry. Each entry is an identifier for the responsible component that will remove the entry from the list. If the deletionTimestamp of the object is non-nil, entries in this list can only be removed.|
