**表 1**  路径参数

|参数|是否必选|参数类型|描述|
|--|--|--|--|
|namespace|是|String|object name and auth scope, such as for teams and projects|


**表 2**  Query参数

|参数|是否必选|参数类型|描述|
|--|--|--|--|
|continue|否|String|The continue option should be set when retrieving more results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients may only use the continue value from a previous query result with identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration change on the server the server will respond with a 410 ResourceExpired error indicating the client must restart their list without the continue field. This field is not supported when watch is true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value returned by the server and not miss any modifications.|
|fieldSelector|否|String|A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their fields. Defaults to everything.|
|includeUninitialized|否|Boolean|If true, partially initialized resources are included in the response.|
|labelSelector|否|String|A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their labels. Defaults to everything.|
|limit|否|Integer|limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call. If more items exist, the server will set the *continue* field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.The server guarantees that the objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created, modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the time the first list result was calculated is returned.|
|resourceVersion|否|String|When specified with a watch call, shows changes that occur after that particular version of a resource. Defaults to changes from the beginning of history. When specified for list: - if unset, then the result is returned from remote storage based on quorum-read flag; - if it's 0, then we simply return what we currently have in cache, no guarantee; - if set to non zero, then the result is at least as fresh as given rv.|
|timeoutSeconds|否|Integer|Timeout for the list/watch call. This limits the duration of the call, regardless of any activity or inactivity.|
|watch|否|Boolean|Watch for changes to the described resources and return them as a stream of add, update, and remove notifications. Specify resourceVersion.|
|pretty|否|String|If 'true', then the output is pretty printed.|

**表 4**  响应Body参数

|参数|参数类型|描述|
|--|--|--|
|apiVersion|String|APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object. Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value, and may reject unrecognized values. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/api-conventions.md#resources|
|code|Integer|Suggested HTTP return code for this status, 0 if not set.|
|details|io.k8s.apimachinery.pkg.apis.meta.v1.StatusDetails_v3 object|Extended data associated with the reason. Each reason may define its own extended details. This field is optional and the data returned is not guaranteed to conform to any schema except that defined by the reason type.|
|kind|String|Kind is a string value representing the REST resource this object represents. Servers may infer this from the endpoint the client submits requests to. Cannot be updated. In CamelCase. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/api-conventions.md#types-kinds|
|message|String|A human-readable description of the status of this operation.|
|metadata|io.k8s.apimachinery.pkg.apis.meta.v1.ListMeta_v2 object|Standard list metadata. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/api-conventions.md#types-kinds|
|reason|String|A machine-readable description of why this operation is in the "Failure" status. If this value is empty there is no information available. A Reason clarifies an HTTP status code but does not override it.|
|status|String|Status of the operation. One of: "Success" or "Failure". More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/api-conventions.md#spec-and-status|


**表 5**  io.k8s.apimachinery.pkg.apis.meta.v1.StatusDetails\_v3

|参数|参数类型|描述|
|--|--|--|
|causes|Array of io.k8s.apimachinery.pkg.apis.meta.v1.StatusCause_v2 objects|The Causes array includes more details associated with the StatusReason failure. Not all StatusReasons may provide detailed causes.|
|group|String|The group attribute of the resource associated with the status StatusReason.|
|kind|String|The kind attribute of the resource associated with the status StatusReason. On some operations may differ from the requested resource Kind. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/api-conventions.md#types-kinds|
|name|String|The name attribute of the resource associated with the status StatusReason (when there is a single name which can be described).|
|retryAfterSeconds|Integer|If specified, the time in seconds before the operation should be retried. Some errors may indicate the client must take an alternate action - for those errors this field may indicate how long to wait before taking the alternate action.|
|uid|String|UID of the resource. (when there is a single resource which can be described). More info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/identifiers#uids|


**表 6**  io.k8s.apimachinery.pkg.apis.meta.v1.StatusCause\_v2

|参数|参数类型|描述|
|--|--|--|
|field|String|The field of the resource that has caused this error, as named by its JSON serialization. May include dot and postfix notation for nested attributes. Arrays are zero-indexed.  Fields may appear more than once in an array of causes due to fields having multiple errors. Optional.Examples: "name" - the field "name" on the current resource "items[0].name" - the field "name" on the first array entry in "items"|
|message|String|A human-readable description of the cause of the error. This field may be presented as-is to a reader.|
|reason|String|A machine-readable description of the cause of the error. If this value is empty there is no information available.|


**表 7**  io.k8s.apimachinery.pkg.apis.meta.v1.ListMeta\_v2

|参数|参数类型|描述|
|--|--|--|
|continue|String|continue may be set if the user set a limit on the number of items returned, and indicates that the server has more data available. The value is opaque and may be used to issue another request to the endpoint that served this list to retrieve the next set of available objects. Continuing a list may not be possible if the server configuration has changed or more than a few minutes have passed. The resourceVersion field returned when using this continue value will be identical to the value in the first response.|
|resourceVersion|String|String that identifies the server's internal version of this object that can be used by clients to determine when objects have changed. Value must be treated as opaque by clients and passed unmodified back to the server. Populated by the system. Read-only. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/api-conventions.md#concurrency-control-and-consistency|
|selfLink|String|selfLink is a URL representing this object. Populated by the system. Read-only.|
