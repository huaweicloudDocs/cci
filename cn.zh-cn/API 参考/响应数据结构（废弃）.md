**表 15**  metadata字段数据结构说明

|参数|参数类型|描述|
|--|--|--|
|name|String|Name must be unique within a namespace. Is required when creating resources, although some resources may allow a client to request the generation of an appropriate name automatically. Name is primarily intended for creation idempotence and configuration definition. Cannot be updated.|
|clusterName|String|The name of the cluster which the object belongs to. This is used to distinguish resources with same name and namespace in different clusters. This field is not set anywhere right now and apiserver is going to ignore it if set in create or update request.|
|initializers|initializers object|An initializer is a controller which enforces some system invariant at object creation time. This field is a list of initializers that have not yet acted on this object. If nil or empty, this object has been completely initialized. Otherwise, the object is considered uninitialized and is hidden (in list/watch and get calls) from clients that haven't explicitly asked to observe uninitialized objects. When an object is created, the system will populate this list with the current set of initializers. Only privileged users may set or modify this list. Once it is empty, it may not be modified further by any user.|
|generateName|String|GenerateName is an optional prefix, used by the server, to generate a unique name ONLY IF the Name field has not been provided. If this field is used, the name returned to the client will be different from the name passed. This value will also be combined with a unique suffix. The provided value has the same validation rules as the Name field, and may be truncated by the length of the suffix required to make the value unique on the server.If this field is specified and the generated name exists, the server will NOT return a 409 - instead, it will either return 201 Created or 500 with Reason ServerTimeout indicating a unique name could not be found in the time allotted, and the client should retry (optionally after the time indicated in the Retry-After header).Applied only if Name is not specified.|
|namespace|String|Namespace defines the space within each name must be unique. An empty namespace is equivalent to the "default" namespace, but "default" is the canonical representation. Not all objects are required to be scoped to a namespace - the value of this field for those objects will be empty. Must be a DNS_LABEL. Cannot be updated.|
|selfLink|String|SelfLink is a URL representing this object. Populated by the system. Read-only.|
|uid|String|UID is the unique in time and space value for this object. It is typically generated by the server on successful creation of a resource and is not allowed to change on PUT operations. Populated by the system. Read-only.|
|resourceVersion|String|An opaque value that represents the internal version of this object that can be used by clients to determine when objects have changed. May be used for optimistic concurrency, change detection, and the watch operation on a resource or set of resources. Clients must treat these values as opaque and passed unmodified back to the server. They may only be valid for a particular resource or set of resources. Populated by the system. Read-only. Value must be treated as opaque by clients.|
|generation|Integer|A sequence number representing a specific generation of the desired state. Currently only implemented by replication controllers. Populated by the system. Read-only.|
|creationTimestamp|String|CreationTimestamp is a timestamp representing the server time when this object was created. It is not guaranteed to be set in happens-before order across separate operations. Clients may not set this value. It is represented in RFC3339 form and is in UTC. Populated by the system. Read-only. Null for lists.|
|deletionTimestamp|String|DeletionTimestamp is RFC 3339 date and time at which this resource will be deleted. This field is set by the server when a graceful deletion is requested by the user, and is not directly settable by a client. The resource will be deleted (no longer visible from resource lists, and not reachable by name) after the time in this field. Once set, this value may not be unset or be set further into the future, although it may be shortened or the resource may be deleted prior to this time. For example, a user may request that a pod is deleted in 30 seconds. The Kubelet will react by sending a graceful termination signal to the containers in the pod. Once the resource is deleted in the API, the Kubelet will send a hard termination signal to the container. If not set, graceful deletion of the object has not been requested. Populated by the system when a graceful deletion is requested. Read-only.|
|deletionGracePeriodSeconds|Integer|Number of seconds allowed for this object to gracefully terminate before it will be removed from the system. Only set when deletionTimestamp is also set. May only be shortened. Read-only.|
|labels|Map[string]string|Map of string keys and values that can be used to organize and categorize (scope and select) objects. May match selectors of replication controllers and services.|
|Annotations|Map[string]string|Annotations is an unstructured key value map stored with a resource that may be set by external tools to store and retrieve arbitrary metadata. They are not queryable and should be preserved when modifying objects.|
|ownerReferences|ownerReferences object|List of objects depended by this object. If ALL objects in the list have been deleted, this object will be garbage collected. If this object is managed by a controller, then an entry in this list will point to this controller, with the controller field set to true. There cannot be more than one managing controller.|
|finalizers|Array of strings|Must be empty before the object is deleted from the registry. Each entry is an identifier for the responsible component that will remove the entry from the list. If the deletionTimestamp of the object is non-nil, entries in this list can only be removed.|

**表 57**  Status v1中reason值说明

|名称|值|描述|
|--|--|--|
|StatusReasonUnknown|“”|StatusReasonUnknown means the server has declined to indicate a specific reason. The details field may contain other information about this error.**Status code 500**|
|StatusReasonUnauthorized|Unauthorized|StatusReasonUnauthorized means the server can be reached and understood the request, but requires the user to present appropriate authorization credentials (identified by the WWW-Authenticate header) in order for the action to be completed. If the user has specified credentials on the request, the server considers them insufficient.**Status code 401**|
|StatusReasonForbidden|Forbidden|StatusReasonForbidden means the server can be reached and understood the request, but refuses to take any further action. It is the result of the server being configured to deny access for some reason to the requested resource by the client.Details (optional):"kind" string - the kind attribute of the forbidden resource on some operations may differ from the requestedresource. "id" string - the identifier of the forbidden resource**Status code 403**|
|StatusReasonNotFound|NotFound|StatusReasonNotFound means one or more resources required for this operation could not be found.Details (optional):"kind" string - the kind attribute of the missing resource on some operations may differ from the requested resource."id" string - the identifier of the missing resource**Status code 404**|
|StatusReasonAlreadyExists|AlreadyExists|StatusReasonAlreadyExists means the resource you are creating already exists.Details (optional):"kind" string - the kind attribute of the conflicting resource"id" string - the identifier of the conflicting resource**Status code 409**|
|StatusReasonConflict|Conflict|StatusReasonConflict means the requested operation cannot be completed due to a conflict in the operation. The client may need to alter the request. Each resource may define custom details that indicate the nature of the conflict.**Status code 409**|
|StatusReasonGone|Gone|StatusReasonGone means the item is no longer available at the server and no forwarding address is known.**Status code 410**|
|StatusReasonInvalid|Invalid|StatusReasonInvalid means the requested create or update operation cannot be completed due to invalid data provided as part of the request. The client may need to alter the request. When set, the client may use the StatusDetailsmessage field as a summary of the issues encountered.Details (optional):"kind" string - the kind attribute of the invalid resource"id" string - the identifier of the invalid resource"causes" - one or more StatusCause entries indicating the data in the provided resource that was invalid. The code, message, and field attributes will be set.**Status code 422**|
|StatusReasonServerTimeout|ServerTimeout|StatusReasonServerTimeout means the server can be reached and understood the request, but cannot complete the action in a reasonable time. The client should retry the request. This is probably due to temporary server load or a transient communication issue with another server. Status code 500 is used because the HTTP spec provides no suitableserver-requested client retry and the 5xx class represents actionable errors.Details (optional):"kind" string - the kind attribute of the resource being acted on."id" string - the operation that is being attempted."retryAfterSeconds" int32 - the number of seconds before the operation should be retried**Status code 500**|
|StatusReasonTimeout|Timeout|StatusReasonTimeout means that the request could not be completed within the given time. Clients can get this response only when they specified a timeout param in the request, or if the server cannot complete the operation within a reasonable amount of time. The request might succeed with an increased value of timeout param. The client *should*wait at least the number of seconds specified by the retryAfterSeconds field. Details (optional):"retryAfterSeconds" int32 - the number of seconds before the operation should be retried**Status code 504**|
|StatusReasonBadRequest|BadRequest|StatusReasonBadRequest means that the request itself was invalid, because the request does not make any sense, for example deleting a read-only object. This is different from StatusReasonInvalid above which indicates that the API call could possibly succeed, but the data was invalid. API calls that return BadRequest can never succeed.|
|StatusReasonMethodNotAllowed|MethodNotAllowed|StatusReasonMethodNotAllowed means that the action the client attempted to perform on the resource was not supported by the code - for instance, attempting to delete a resource that can only be created. API calls that return MethodNotAllowed can never succeed.|
|StatusReasonInternalError|InternalError|StatusReasonInternalError indicates that an internal error occurred, it is unexpected and the outcome of the call is unknown.Details (optional):"causes" - The original error**Status code 500**|
|StatusReasonExpired|Expired|StatusReasonExpired indicates that the request is invalid because the content you are requesting has expired and is no longer available. It is typically associated with watches that cannot be serviced.**Status code 410 (gone)**|
|StatusReasonServiceUnavailable|ServiceUnavailable|StatusReasonServiceUnavailable means that the request itself was valid, but the requested service is unavailable at this time. Retrying the request after some time might succeed.**Status code 503**|
